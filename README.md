CAMDF-Net: Context-Aware Multi-Domain Fusion Network for Robust Cotton Leaf Disease Detection with Enhanced Multi-Scale Segmentation
# ABSTRACT
Cotton (Gossypium spp.), often referred to as “white gold”, is one of the most economically significant non-food agricultural commodities globally, supporting approximately 250 million livelihoods worldwide. However, cotton production faces substantial challenges from various leaf diseases that can significantly reduce yield and fiber quality. Early and accurate disease detection is crucial for implementing timely interventions and minimizing crop losses. This paper presents CAMDF-Net (Context-Aware Multi-Domain Fusion Network), a novel hybrid deep learning architecture that synergistically combines Vision Transformer (ViT) and EfficientNet with advanced spectral preprocessing and multi-domain feature fusion mechanisms for precise cotton leaf disease classification. The proposed architecture introduces a spectral pre-processor that enhances disease-relevant features in the frequency domain, a pyramid pooling module for multi-scale context aggregation, and a cross-attention mechanism that enables bidirectional information exchange between CNN and transformer features. Additionally, our model incorporates a segmentation head for disease region localization and an uncertainty estimation module for reliability assessment. Evaluated on a comprehensive dataset of 1,373 original and 4,963 augmented cotton leaf images spanning five disease categories (Healthy Leaf, Bacterial Blight, Alternaria Leaf Spot, Fusarium Wilt, and Verticillium Wilt), CAMDF-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance with 99.5% accuracy, 99.4% precision, 99.8% recall, and 99.3% F1-score. Comprehensive ablation studies and attention visualization analyses demonstrate the effectiveness of each component in the proposed architecture. The model significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches, establishing a new benchmark for automated cotton plant disease detection systems in precision agriculture.
